What does lazy mean?,A property whose initial value is not assigned until a property is used for the first time. 
What does fileprivate mean?,An entity is accessible only from the file in which it was declared(e.g. a fileprivate property in a class will only be accessible by other entities defined inside the file in which it was declared).
What does private mean?,An entity is only accessible from the context in which it was created (e.g. a private property in a class will only be accessible from methods of the same class).
What is a delegate?,"A delegate is a object that receives events from, and provides info about it’s parent."
Why would you make a class final?,final is used is a class when we don’t want the code to create subclasses of it
What does internal mean?,An entity is accessible only inside the module in which it was created.  Internal is the default access mode for applications.
What does open mean?,An entity that is accessible from the module it belongs to and to other modules.
What does public mean?,An entity is accessible from the module it belongs to and other modules. You can’t create subclasses of public classes outside of the module in which they were defined. Public methods can’t be overridden outside the module in which they were created.
When would you use the ‘defer’ keyword in Swift?,"Defer is used to delay a piece of work until a function ends, similar to how try/finally works in other languages. It is often used for cleanup or finalization tasks, ensuring certain operations are performed before leaving the current code block. Defer can be used for saving a file once everything has been written. You can defer multiple pieces of work and they get executed in reverse as Swift unwinds the defer stack."
What are conditional conformances?,"Protocol conformances allow us to say that one type conforms to a protocol such as Hashable or Equatable. Conditional conformances conform to a protocol only if a condition is true. You need the + operation for conforming types. Conditional conformances are useful in scenarios where a type should conform to a protocol only if certain conditions are satisfied. It enables more expressive and flexible code, especially when working with generic types."
How does the Singleton Design pattern apply in iOS and when is it useful?,"A singleton ensures that a class only has one instance and provides a global point of access. It’s useful for shared resources like configurations or network sessions, ensuring consistent behavior throughout the app."
What are opaque return types?,"Whenever you see the ‘some’ return type, it’s the opaque return type. An opaque type is when you want to specify that kind of type will be returned but you don’t want to say what type.The compiler knows what data is return even if you don’t get access to it."
What is async/await?,"It handles asynchronous code, in a sequential and readable manner.  It simplifies tasks like fetching data from a remote server or performing background operations. Mark functions using async and await keywords. ‘Async’ indicates it contains async code and ‘await’ pauses the execution until a specific async task is completed."
When would you use @autoclosure?,"@autoclosure turns a function’s parameter into a closure so that it can be executed on demand rather than immediately. Ex: assert() - the auto closure behavior here ensures our assertion doesn’t happen in release mode, it only occurs in debug mode."
What is the difference between ‘self’ and ‘Self’?,self’ is the current object your code is running inside and ‘Self’ refers to the current type your code is running inside.
What are the async function rules?,"Synchronous functions cannot call async functions directly, Swift will throw an error. Async functions can call other async functions. Async functions can call synchronous functions. If you have async and synchronous functions that can be called in the same way, Swift would prefer whichever one matches your current context, if the call site is currently async it will call async otherwise it will call a synchronous function."
Define and provide useful examples of enum associated values?,"Enum associated values let us attach one or more extra pieces of data to enum cases. Ex: A weather enum that lists sunny, windy, and rainy as cases, but has an associated value for cloudy so that you can store the cloud coverage."
